^ for the above data, calculate factors that include total households
^ and if there is a half a mile radius that comes off the road, then calculate how much of
the block group's area is "covered" with this information, and how that correlates with ridership

see if it is possible to calculate total rail and bus connections
for every # number of mile, how many subway / bus stations are accessible
^ above is given a "value"
^ an provide a 'value' for each station added

see if there is correlation between income and ridership in nyc, see if there is census data for this

check for household / home count per block group, see how that correlates with vehicle usage

calculate 100 - vehicle commute

calculate rail + walking
